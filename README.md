## 1. Project Overview

This project showcases a dynamic and interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** developed for **Creatine House**, a prominent sport supplement brand. The dashboard offers an in-depth analysis of the company's sales data from **2010 to 2013**, transforming raw transactional information into a cohesive and visually intuitive tool. Its primary goal is to empower stakeholders with clear, actionable insights to optimize business strategies and significantly increase profitability.

## 2. Problem Statement

Creatine House faced the challenge of making sense of four years of sales data spread across various sources, lacking a centralized, real-time view of their performance. This hindered their ability to identify core trends, understand customer behavior, manage returns effectively, and make informed decisions on product strategy and geographical expansion. The need was for a comprehensive analytical solution that could translate complex data into clear, profit-driving strategies.

## 3. Dashboard Features & Analysis Sections

The dashboard is meticulously designed with distinct, interactive sections, each addressing critical business dimensions:

* **Revenue Analysis:**
    * Provides a high-level overview of **Revenue, Profit, Cost, and Quantity** over the four-year period.
    * Visualizes **Revenue and GM% Overtime** (Quarterly and Annually), identifying periods of growth, decline, and profit margin trends.
    * Breaks down **Revenue by Country** (e.g., United States, Canada, France) and **Revenue by Category** (e.g., Protein, Carbs, Amino Acids), highlighting top-performing markets and product segments.
    * Shows **Revenue by Business Type** (e.g., Warehouse, Supplement, Gym), indicating key sales channels.
